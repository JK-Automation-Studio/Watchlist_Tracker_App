This app was designed to be a repository for collecting all the movies one would like to watch. You can save movies to the playlist to view later on when deciding what to watch etc. This is my first hobby app built from scratch with no Youtube tutorials or anything like that. The app has a few different screens and dialogs, as well as user input, photo picker intent, and JSON persistence.
