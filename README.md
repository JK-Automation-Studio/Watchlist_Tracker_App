This app was designed to be a repository for collecting all the movies one would like to watch. You can save movies to the playlist to view later on when deciding what to watch etc. This is my first hobby app built from scratch with no Youtube tutorials or anything like that. I know there is likely errors I have missed, as well as compatibility issues I have not been able to test, but I am proud of the app.

 
 


Playlist Library View

This view is the main screen of the app, showing the various movie titles the user has added.

Add Listing View

This dialog shows up when a user wants to add a new movie to the library.

The same dialog as the add listing, this allows one to edit the info of an existing movie listing.
